        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <i>The Scratch Privacy Policy was last updated: October 5, 2020</i>
        <p>
            The Scratch Foundation (&ldquo;Scratch&rdquo;, &ldquo;we&rdquo; or &ldquo;us&rdquo;) understands how
            important privacy is to our community. We wrote this Privacy Policy to explain what Personal Information
            (&ldquo;Information&rdquo;) we collect through our offline editor (the &ldquo;<a
                href="https://scratch.mit.edu/download"

                rel="noopener noreferrer"
            title="Scratch App">Scratch App</a>&rdquo;), how we use, process, and share it, and what we&apos;re doing to keep it safe. It
            also tells you about your rights and choices with respect to your Personal Information, and how you can <a

                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer"
            title="Contact us">contact us</a> if you have any questions or concerns.
        </p>
        <h2>What Information Does Scratch Collect About Me?</h2>
        <p>
            For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, &ldquo;Information&rdquo; means any information relating to an
            identified or identifiable individual. The Scratch App automatically collects and stores locally the
            following Information through its telemetry system: the title of your project in text form, language
            setting, time zone and events related to your use of the Scratch App (namely when the Scratch App was
            opened and closed, if a project file has been loaded or saved, or if a new project is created). If you
            choose to turn on the telemetry sharing feature, the Scratch App will transmit this information to Scratch.
            Projects created in the Scratch App are not transmitted to or accessible by Scratch.
        </p>
        <h2>How Does Scratch Use My Information?</h2>
        <p>We use this Information for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Analytics and Improving the Scratch App</b> - We use the Information to analyze use of the Scratch
                App and to enhance your learning experience on the Scratch App.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Academic and Scientific Research</b> - We de-identify and aggregate Information for statistical
                analysis in the context of scientific and academic research. For example, to help us understand how
                people learn through the Scratch App and how we can enhance learning tools for young people. The
                results of such research are shared with educators and researchers through conferences, journals, and
                other academic or scientific publications. You can find out more on our <a
                    href="https://scratch.mit.edu/research"
                    target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer"
                title="Research page">Research page</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Legal</b> - We may use your Information to enforce our <a
                    href="https://scratch.mit.edu/terms_of_use"
                    target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer"
                title="Terms of Use">Terms of Use</a>, to defend our legal rights, and to comply with our legal obligations and internal
                policies. We may do this by analyzing your use of the Scratch App.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What Are The Legal Grounds For Processing Your Information?</h2>
        <p>
            If you are located in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom or Switzerland, we only process your
            Information based on a valid legal ground. A &ldquo;legal ground&rdquo; is a reason that justifies our use
            of your Information. In this case, we or a third party have a legitimate interest in using your Information
            (if you choose to allow the Scratch App to send the Scratch team your Information) to create, analyze and
            share your aggregated or de-identified Information for research purposes, to analyze and enhance your
            learning experience on the Scratch App and otherwise ensure and improve the safety, security, and
            performance of the Scratch App. We only rely on our or a third party’s legitimate interests to process your
            Information when these interests are not overridden by your rights and interests.
        </p>
        <h2>How Does Scratch Share My Information?</h2>
        <p>
            We disclose information that we collect through the Scratch App to third parties in the following
            circumstances:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Service Providers</b> - To third parties who provide services such as website hosting, data
                analysis, Information technology and related infrastructure provisions, customer service, email
                delivery, and other services.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Academic and Scientific Research</b> - To research institutions, such as the Massachusetts Institute
                of Technology (MIT), to learn about how our users learn through the Scratch App and develop new
                learning tools. The results of this research or the statistical analysis may be shared through
                conferences, journals, and other publications.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Merger</b> - To a potential or actual acquirer, successor, or assignee as part of any
                reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or any
                portion of our organization or assets. You will have the opportunity to opt out of any such transfer if
                the new entity&apos;s planned processing of your Information differs materially from that set forth in
                this Privacy Policy.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Legal</b> - If required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is appropriate:
                (A) under applicable law, including laws outside your country of residence; (B) to comply with legal
                process; (C) to respond to requests from public and government authorities, such as school, school
                districts, and law enforcement, including public and government authorities outside your country of
                residence; (D) to enforce our terms and conditions; (E) to protect our operations or those of any of
                our affiliates; (F) to protect our rights, privacy, safety, or property, and/or that of our affiliates,
                you, or others; and (G) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may
                sustain.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Children And Student Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            The Scratch Foundation is a 501(C)(3) nonprofit organization. As such, the Children&apos;s Online Privacy
            Protection Act (COPPA) does not apply to Scratch. Nevertheless, Scratch takes children&apos;s privacy
            seriously. Scratch collects only minimal information from its users, and only uses and discloses
            information to provide the services and for limited other purposes, such as research, as described in this
            Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Scratch does not collect information from a student&apos;s education record, as defined by the Family
            Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). Scratch does not disclose information of students to any third
            parties except as described in this Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <h2>Your Data Protection Rights (EEA)</h2>
        <p>
            If you are located in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom or Switzerland, you have certain
            rights in relation to your Information:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Access, Correction and Data Portability</b> - You may ask for an overview of the Information we
                process about you and to receive a copy of your Information. You also have the right to request to
                correct incomplete, inaccurate or outdated Information. To the extent required by applicable law, you
                may request us to provide your Information to another company.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Objection</b> – You may object to (this means &ldquo;ask us to stop&rdquo;) any use of your
                Information that is not (I) processed to comply with a legal obligation, (II) necessary to do what is
                provided in a contract between Scratch and you, or (III) if we have a compelling reason to do so (such
                as, to ensure safety and security in our online community). If you do object, we will work with you to
                find a reasonable solution.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Deletion</b> - You may also request the deletion of your Information, as permitted under applicable
                law. This applies, for instance, where your Information is outdated or the processing is not necessary
                or is unlawful; where you withdraw your consent to our processing based on such consent; or where you
                have objected to our processing. In some situations, we may need to retain your Information due to
                legal obligations or for litigation purposes. If you want to have all of your Information removed from
                our servers, please contact <a
                    href="mailto:help@scratch.mit.edu"
                    target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer"
                title="help@scratch.mit.edu">help@scratch.mit.edu</a> for assistance.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Restriction Of Processing</b> - You may request that we restrict processing of your Information
                while we are processing a request relating to (I) the accuracy of your Information, (II) the lawfulness
                of the processing of your Information, or (III) our legitimate interests to process this Information.
                You may also request that we restrict processing of your Information if you wish to use the Information
                for litigation purposes.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Withdrawal Of Consent</b> – Where we rely on consent for the processing of your Information, you
                have the right to withdraw it at any time and free of charge. When you do so, this will not affect the
                lawfulness of the processing before your consent withdrawal.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In addition to the above-mentioned rights, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with a competent
            supervisory authority subject to applicable law. However, there are exceptions and limitations to each of
            these rights. We may, for example, refuse to act on a request if the request is manifestly unfounded or
            excessive, or if the request is likely to adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others, prejudice the
            execution or enforcement of the law, interfere with pending or future litigation, or infringe applicable
            law. To submit a request to exercise your rights, please contact <a
                href="mailto:help@scratch.mit.edu"

        </p>
        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
            We take measures to delete your Information or keep it in a form that does not allow you to be identified
            when this Information is no longer necessary for the purposes for which we process it, unless we are
            required by law to keep this Information for a longer period. When determining the retention period, we
            take into account various criteria, such as the type of services requested by or provided to you, the
            nature and length of our relationship with you, possible re-enrollment with our services, the impact on the
            services we provide to you if we delete some Information from or about you, mandatory retention periods
            provided by law and the statute of limitations.
        </p>
        <h2>How Does Scratch Protect My Information?</h2>
        <p>
            Scratch has in place administrative, physical, and technical procedures that are intended to protect the
            Information we collect on the Scratch App against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss,
            unauthorized alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, misuse, and any other unlawful form of
            processing of the Information. However, as effective as these measures are, no security system is
            impenetrable. We cannot completely guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that the
            Information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet.
        </p>
        <h2>International Data Transfer</h2>
        <p>
            We may transfer your Information to countries other than the country where you are located, including to
            the U.S. (where our Scratch servers are located) or any other country in which we or our service providers
            maintain facilities. If you are located in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom or Switzerland,
            or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note
            that we may transfer your Information to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data
            protection laws as your jurisdiction. We apply appropriate safeguards to the Information processed and
            transferred on our behalf. Please contact us for more information on the safeguards used.
        </p>
        <h2>Notifications Of Changes To The Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We review our Privacy Policy on a periodic basis, and we may modify our policies as appropriate. We will
            notify you of any material changes. We encourage you to review our Privacy Policy on a regular basis. The
            &ldquo;Last Updated&rdquo; date at the top of this page indicates when this Privacy Policy was last
            revised. Your continued use of the Scratch App following these changes means that you accept the revised
            Privacy Policy.
